                Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to 
                either the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which 
                is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce 
                and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the 
                lasagna noodles.

            <h1>ingredients</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 breast half, bone and skin removed (blank)s skinless, boneless chicken breasts </li> 
                    <li>1 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning, or to taste </li> 
                    <li>3 slices Monterey Jack cheese </li> 
                    <li>6 spears fresh asparagus </li> 
                    <li>9 slices bacon </li> 
                    <li>12 each wooden toothpicks </li> 
                </ul>

                <ol>
                    <li> Step 1: Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) if recommended by manufacturer.
                        </li>
                    <li> Step 2: Pat chicken pieces dry with paper towels. Use a sharp knife slice horizontally through the middle, beginning at the thickest part, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side. Open the 2 sides and spread them out like an open book.
                        </li>
                    <li> Step 3: Season both sides with lemon-pepper seasoning. Place 1 slice of cheese on each chicken breast. Cut asparagus spears in half and place 4 halves on top of the cheese. Roll the chicken up and over the cheese and asparagus, keeping the stuffing inside each roll. Wrap each chicken breast with 3 pieces of bacon, using wooden toothpicks to secure the bacon, where it overlaps.
                        </li>
                    <li> Step 4: Place each bacon-wrapped breast in the air fryer basket and air fry for 15 minutes. Turn and cook for 15 minutes more. Test chicken for doneness; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should reach 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
                         </li>
                </ol>
